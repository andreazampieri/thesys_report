	\section{Introduction} 
		I started from the Zekarias	T. Kefato's paper: \textit{DeepInfer: Diffusion Network Inference through Representation Learning}.\\
		The problem tackled in this paper (as described by its title) is infering a network starting from series of interactions between the elements in play.
		The goal is to obtain a reconstruction as precise as possible of the actual \textbf{Interaction Network} without using any kind of exact information on the actual graph.\\ 
		\\
		\textbf{Note:} for semplicity and immediacy sake, during the explanation I will make references to a specific example in order to show an instance of the problem:\\
		\tab \textbf{\textit{Twitter}}: the interactions observed are formed by:\\
			\tab\tab - \textit{contagiant element}: the ones taken in consideration are the \textit{hashtags} \\
			\tab\tab - \textit{infection spreading}: and for each hashtag there's a list of users (with its respective time) that used it.
